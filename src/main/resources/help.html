<h1>DriveDog help</h1>
<h2 id"whatIsDriveDog">What is DriveDog</h2>
<p>
This is a utility that will try to keep your google drive and Linux directory in sync. 
Delete a file locally in $HOME/drivedog and DriveDog will move to the bin the file on google drive.<br>
<b>limitation, DriveDog doesn't pick up files deleted on google drive, you will need to remove these yourself in $HOME/drivedog</b>
</p>
<h2 id="fullRun">Full run</h2>
this option removes the marker file DriveDog uses to track changes. Removing this file will mean the next run will examine all 
files for download rather than anything newer than last successful run
<h2 id="conflicts1">Conflicts</h2>
conflicts happen when both the local linux drive copy of a file in $HOME/drivedog has been edited and the same file on Google Drive has been edited. 
DriveDog doesn't know which one to keep. 
<h2 id="conflicts2">Resolve conflict, keep file copy on google drive</h2>
remove the file on local storage and the conflict indicator file. For example<br>
rm football.txt<br>
rm .drivedog/.football.txt.conflict<br>
<h2 id="conflicts3">Resolve conflict, keep local file edit on Linux</h2>
Go to Google Drive and remove the file to the bin, then remove the conflict indicator, e.g.<br>
rm .drivedog/.football.txt.conflict<br>
<br>
if you remove the file permanently then DriveDog will delete the file locally.
<h2 id="delete">if DriveDog deletes a file</h2>
the file deleted will be renamed/moved to the .drivedog directory, e.g.<br>
file football.txt would be moved to .drivedog/football.txt
<h2 id="renaming">renaming files on google</h2>
DriveDog gets in a mess with this. The problem now is the file title's will be different but the unique identifier remains the same.<br>
DriveDog gets in a mess with this!
<h2 id="renaming">renaming files locally</h2>
renaming a file locally (mv'ing) will result in the original file on Google being removed and a new file being created.
<h2 id="duplicatenames">same filename but 2 instances on Google drive</h2>
the way google drive works, there is nothing to stop 2 files or directories having the same name. They will have unique id's internally. 
This will cause conflicts for DriveDog as unix filesystem doesn't support this
